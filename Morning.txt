Morning is the period of time between midnight and noon, especially from sunrise to noon. There are no exact times for when morning begins and ends (also true for evening and night) because they can vary according to one's lifestyle and the hours of daylight at each time of year. However, morning strictly ends at noon, which is when afternoon starts. Morning can be defined as starting from midnight to noon, or from sunrise (which varies throughout the year) to noon, or from when one wakes up to noon.Morning precedes afternoon, evening, and night in the sequence of a day. Originally, the term referred to sunrise.
